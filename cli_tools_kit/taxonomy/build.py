"""Compute the tool grouping and write data/tool_groups.json.

The one place that decides the bands and writes the file. regroup.py calls it
to rebuild on demand; groups.ensure_groups calls it when the installer starts
and the stored grouping no longer matches the corpus.

Three ways to get there, tried in order:

1. **gemini** — reads a condensed blurb per tool and returns named categories
   with their members. The normal path: naming a category is a language task.
2. **capability**, when a grouping is already stored — keep those bands and
   their names, and file only the tools missing from them by the capability
   word they advertise. No network. Preferred over re-embedding because it
   preserves names a model chose over names tf-idf would invent.
3. **embed** — no stored grouping to extend, so cluster the full documents and
   name each cluster after its most distinctive token. Needs an embedding
   backend; if that is missing too, fall back to capability words alone.

Only the first needs an API key, and only steps 1 and 3 need a network. A
distributed checkout ships with data/tool_groups.json already written, so it
never reaches any of them until its owner adds a tool of their own.
